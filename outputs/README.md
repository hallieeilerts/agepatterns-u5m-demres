## Figure 3:Age pattern of mortality under 5
![fig1](fig1.jpeg)
Note: a: Scatter plot showing the relationship between infant and child mortality in HDSS, DHS, and MICS from sub-Saharan Africa,
and high-mortality observations from the HMD. The black solid line is the model estimate of the relationship between the two indicators,
derived from high-quality CRVS data. Dashed and dotted lines indicate model predictions under different age patterns of U5M. b: Box
plots showing the ratio of child-to-infant mortality in each source, and disaggregated by African subregion.

periods.
